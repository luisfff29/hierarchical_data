# Create Your Own Hierarchical Data

Using Modified Preorder Tree Transversal (MPTT), it's possible to treat the data like a gigantic tree,
with a single starting point (the "root" boject) and parents, siblings, and children galore.

## Instructions

1. After making migrates and migrate the models we should create super user using `python manage.py createsuperuser`
2. Then, log in into your account and you can start creating new folders/files for your own tree!
3. Finally, you are optional to create new users and store their own trees base on the user is currently log in.

## Animals hierarchical data

There is already a user created, you can see the Hierarchical Data of the animals and feel free to play with it.

The username is `apple` and the password is `1234`.
